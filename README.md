# JumboTrack

A web application designed to help college students make smarter decisions about where and when to go on campus. By providing real-time occupancy data for popular campus facilities—such as gyms, dining halls—students can better plan their activities and avoid overcrowded locations.

## About

This web application is designed for college students to keep track of the amount of people using certain campus facilities within a
certain time. Some key highlights of the project are: 

- Utilizes JavaScript for effective management of the web application's back end
- Integrates Google Cloud API to extract real time data of students entering and leaving a certain facility
- Implements a user-friendly interface with HTML and CSS
- Displays real time busyness of each location


## Features

- **List Management**: Create and manage lists of students at each location.
- **API Integration**: Fetches student data (name, identification, time, location) from external sources.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean, intuitive, and user-friendly interface designed for a seamless and enjoyable experience.


## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- External APIs
- CoPilot
- ChatGPT


## Getting Started

To run this web application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Configure your API keys and settings (if required) in the fetchStudent.js file.
3. Right-click and download the entire 'Jumbohack' file.
4. Open up the 'Jumbohack' file on finder and double-click on the index.html file to open in browser.


## Feature Expansion
- **Pop-Up Window**: We hope to include a pop-up window after users click on read 'learn more' which
would display the real-time busyness of certain campus facilities. 
- **Log-In Page**: Rather than constantly taking in data from users through scanning in their ID cards,
we hope to implement a one-time log-in feature that keeps students within the database rather than taking them
in and out upon arrival and departure.
- **Graphical Representation**: We hope to include live-view graphical representation (histograms) to allow
for better visuals of how busy a certain facility is at a particular time of day. 
- **Accuracy**: If given a bigger and more efficient database, we want to improve on the overall accuracy of our
prediction model based on the times recorded on a particular day of the week. 
**More Facilities**: We hope to include more facilities, such as study spaces to further maximize students' times.


## Scalability
- **Other Institutions**: Given more time, funding, and data, this web application can be expanded to other
colleges and universities (e.g. Northeastern University) whose students would benefit from this website.
